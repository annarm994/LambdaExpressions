# Java Lambda Expressions Assignment

## Objective:
The objective of this project is to demonstrate the usage of lambda expressions in Java, including their application in functional interfaces, collections, and advanced usage scenarios.

## Project Structure:
- **MathOperation.java**: A functional interface that defines a method for mathematical operations.
- **StringOperation.java**: A custom functional interface for string operations.
- **Main.java**: The main class where lambda expressions are used to implement various tasks like mathematical operations, string operations, sorting, and filtering collections.

## Tasks Implemented:
1. **Task 1**: Runnable Interface with a lambda expression.
2. **Task 2**: Custom `MathOperation` interface with lambda expressions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
3. **Task 3**: Sorting and filtering collections with lambda expressions.
4. **Task 4**: Using built-in functional interfaces like `Predicate` and `Function`.
5. **Task 5**: Advanced usage of lambda expressions including composing functions and custom string operations.

## Instructions to Run:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Compile the Java files:
